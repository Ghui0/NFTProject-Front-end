            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything noble has a beginning and
            an end, as impossible as something may appear as easily it can
            diminish and disappear right in front of your eyes. And that is
            exactly what happened right before my eyes, no one would have
            thought, that our planet, once having conquered the whole solar
            system, would end up in a hopeless situation like this. Not a single
            citizen of the planet Neptune was scared during the leadership of
            our emperor Neptuss, who managed to conquer all nine planets of the
            solar system with his five chosen, most powerful generals, who were
            called the five rising stars. Neptuss was irreplaceable, he was like
            a miracle in this world, I have never seen a person who had nearly
            the same knowledge and capabilities that the emperor had. Therefore,
            everyone knew that nothing would endanger the planet before Neptuss
            was alive and sane. Huh… How silly was I, of course Neptuss was a
            noble person, but he could not defeat seven planets all by himself,
            additionally when traitors were eating our planet inside out. It was
            all my fault, it was my duty to eradicate inner revolution, even
            before the beginning, it was my mission, I was one of the five
            rising stars. Neptuss was really intelligent, he realized what was
            happening from the beginning and this noble person put faith into
            me, one of his best generals, but I made him frustrate. Because of
            my impatience I was trying to do everything quickly, in order to
            join the war with the other planets and because of me being
            impatient I could not sense the large amount of jealousy my best
            friend Grid was carrying. I cannot forgive myself for dooming the
            entire population of our planet to death. I clearly remember that
            day, the beginning of the end, the day when the great war started.
            Neptuss was self-confident and powerful as always. Therefore, people
            believed in him and I was not an exception.

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a huge darkened hall, which had a
            ceiling so tall, that nobody was able to see the end was standing
            Neptuss, there were five rising stars behind him, they represented
            the power of Neptuss. An enormous gate opens, such a huge amount of
            weight made everything tremble. As soon as the gate opened light
            came into the hall, Neptuss went outside and saw the whole
            population of Neptune right in front of his nose spread out, they
            were welcoming our emperor. In a matter of seconds everybody went
            silent in an honor of the emperor and he started his speech:

            declared a war against us, I reckon that they have forgotten what
            actually is the power of Neptune. There is nothing to be afraid of,
            our planet is undefeatable, nobody is able to kneel us until we are
            together. Today I demand my nation to give me power, with your

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone started exulting, everyone
            was clapping for the emperor. Someone may be astonished that people
            were happy before starting a war, but it was mainly because
            everybody believed in the abilities of Neptuss, they were entirely
            sure that their leader would be victorious in every single war.
            Everyone was happy, but one man, my best friend, the emperor&prime;s
            advisor, Grid. He was full of envy, he longed for the power. I
            noticed that, but could not believe, I did not want to believe that
            my best friend would betray us.

        <p class="pstory">
          <em>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The war Began! Enemies were invading
            us non-stop, their army had no end. The sky was full of aircrafts,
            but these huge armies disappeared in a matter of minutes. every time
            they tried to conquer our planet, they were defeated easily. Our
            forces were quickly moving forward and occupying more and more
            territories. Out of the seven planets only one was left. The last
            planet was Mars. That appeared to be the most difficult planet to
            defeat. Battles lasted days and during those days thousands of
            Neptunian soldiers and tens of thousands of Martians. That was the
            moment when I lost my patience, I just could not believe that
            someone would dare and rebel in out planet, despite the fact that
            the emperor did not deny that possibility. I could not keep watching
            that disastrous war from behind the scenes. I sat in my aircraft and
            went straight toward the battlefield on full speed. That day the
            whole planet was soaked with blood. I could easily take thousands of
            lives. in that battle I was given a name of the demon of Neptune.
            The war which had already lasted a month, ended in just a few hours.
            That made me nervous. Yes, I was the strongest out of the five
            rising stars, but the difference between the two sides of the battle
            should not have been that huge with only my helping hand. Every
            soldier was delighted. One more rebellious planet was defeated, or
            was it actually? Suddenly, there was a message of help from our
            planet. All of the five generals headed straight to our planet and
            forgot about the Mars, occupied territories and the possibility that
            enemies could take the control back over their planet. At that time
            our only worry was to find out what happened on Neptune, that
            soldiers needed help. Our only hope was the protective layer which
            was all around the Neptune, it was indestructible and the only way
            to open it was from inside. While approaching the planet there was
            an explosion which shut down our aircrafts. One of the generals
            said:

            “It is impossible, the barrier is blocked, we cannot get in, how
            could our enemies cross the barrier.”

        <p class="pstory">
          <em>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nobody had an answer to that question.
            everyone&prime;s breath stopped. We were standing outside the
            barrier watching our planet getting destroyed unable to do anything.
            Our emperor was fighting until the last breath to defend his planet.
            As it seemed, the traitor, advisor of Neptuss and my best friend
            Grid whom I had known all my life shut down the barrier which was
            created by Bor one of the five rising stars. The Titanium dome was
            supposed to be a perfect and impenetrable barrier. That made all of
            us worry, especially me. I had been through a lot of wars, I had
            been wounded many times, but I had never felt more pain in my entire
            life, than that. No weapon cuts deeper than your best friend&prime;s
            betrayal. I was furious, I could not control myself. I used all my
            weapons to cut through the barrier, but I was unable to even scratch
            it, even with the weapons that killed thousand of enemies and
            aircrafts in seconds. I could not do anything against the Titanium
            barrier, now I knew why it was called the Impenetrable Layer of
            Neptune. We could just watch the battle scenes of the emperor from
            the outside. The battle was uneven. enemy armies had no end. They
            were falling on each other lifeless. Nobody could touch Neptuss. At
            the moment of the triumph, when victory was close, the traitor cut
            straight into the emperor&prime;s back with his spear. Others
            started attacking Neptuss while he was kneeling, but he was not
            giving up, he as fighting until he could breath. It was unbelievable
            even I, the strongest out of the five rising starts, could never
            defeat the emperor. Of course, I knew that he was far more powerful,
            but that was a whole different level. He was moving so swiftly, that
            we could not even see hm, even when he was injured. In a couple of
            minutes not a single soldier was standing. There was only one
            traitor and Neptuss approached him slowly. Grid could not even move
            because of fear. Neptuss finally approached him, looked at him in
            the eyes and started talking in frustrated voice:

            planet&prime;s habitant. Even though you are a traitor, I order you
            one last time to fly away from our planet wherever you want, but
            make sure I never catch a glimpse of you and be grateful, that I did
            not slice you like your comrades”

            sat inside his aircraft and vanished in the boundless galaxy. The
            barrier was opened. Finally, we could walk freely, but it was
            already too late. We were not able to do anything. Every single one
            of us felt the pity, but in reality it was only my fault. Then,
            there was a warning that our enemies were approaching us. That time
            the emperor of Mars himself was coming with his best warriors.
            Possibly we could defeat them, but a lot of Neptunians would have
            died. Frustrated generals were looking at Neptuss and they did not
            know what to do, did we actually lose?

        <p class="pstory">
          <em>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neptuss ordered us to start the
            Phoenix Operation. That was the only moment, when we hesitated after
            hearing the command. That was the only moment, when nobody wanted to
            follow their orders, because the Phoenix Operation meant saving
            every Neptunian in the cost of our emperor&prime;s life. Every
            single soul would get into one stone, the crystal of life, they
            would freeze for some period. That was the only way to escape.
            Tactical retreat before we would be able to regain the strength we
            need. I was ordered to preserve that crystal. I, the one who was
            guilty for all that was happening there. I would be called the only
            weakness of the legendary Neptuss and that name would be the with me
            for the rest of my life. All of that was happening because of me, I
            did not obey the rules, I decided to get to the battlefield and left
            the planet. I could not have disappointed my emperor once more, but
            it seemed like I could not even do a simple task at that point. I
            lost self-confidence, so I denied the command. I decided to get to
            the battlefield, devote my heart and waste our enemies&prime; time
            as much as I could while my allies would take care of the Phoenix
            Operation. While I was fighting with my enemies the operation had
            already ended and somehow I ended up picking up the crystal of life.
            Generals gave me some time to retreat. They sacrificed themselves
            and they made me fly away from the planet with the crystal. A tear
            ran down my face. I was the best warrior out of the five rising
            stars, I have been in many wars and stopped a lot of mighty
            warriors, but at that time I could not stop myself from crying. That
            was the moment when I lost everything: emperor, comrades, nation and
            a best friend. I just… wanted to die… I let go everything, aircraft
            lost its route, my eyes were closing slowly, but in the end, I
            realized that if I died, I could not fulfill my mission. Thousands
            of lives depended on me. It was my duty to survive and regain the
            lost glory for my nation. The war has not ended before I am
            breathing. Before this crystal exists, my nation is alive and so is
            the hope of victory.
